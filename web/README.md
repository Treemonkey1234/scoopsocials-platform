# Scoop - Social Verification & Risk Management Platform

## 🎯 **Mission Statement**
Scoop is a risk management solution that exposes bots and fake accounts at the door—leveraging social data so you can confidently assess risk and ensure authentic connections. At the heart of Scoop is the Trust Score, a credibility rating based on verified activity and connected social accounts.

## 🏗️ **Core Architecture**

### **The "Social Wallet" Concept**
- Users aggregate multiple social platforms into one unified Scoop account
- Platform routing: Direct links to connected accounts (not feed aggregation)

- Transform public social data into valuable risk assessment assets

### **Trust Score System**
- **Credibility rating** based on verified social activity
- **Cross-platform verification** using connected accounts
- **Risk assessment tool** for businesses to identify authentic users
